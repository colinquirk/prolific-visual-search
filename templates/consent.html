            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>We are researchers at the University of Chicago doing a research study about memory. All data collected in this study are for research purposes only. The task involves memory of neutral perceptual stimuli, such as shapes and colors. Participation should take approximately 30 minutes.</p>
            <h2>Risks and Benefits</h2>
            <p>The risks to your participation in this online study are those associated with basic computer tasks, including boredom, fatigue, mild stress, or breach of confidentiality. The only benefit to you is the learning experience from participating in a research study. The benefit to society is the contribution to scientific knowledge.</p>
            <h2>Compensation</h2>
            <p>At $7.50 an hour, this study will pay $3.75 based on the estimated time of completion for the study.</p>
            <p><strong>This study contains a number of checks to make sure that participants are finishing the tasks honestly and completely. As long as you read the instructions and complete the tasks, your task will be approved. If you fail these checks, your task will be rejected.</strong></p>
            <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
            <p>A Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health covers this research. The researchers with this Certificate may not disclose or use information or documents, that may identify you in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other action, suit, or proceeding. Neither can this information be used as evidence (for example, if there is a court subpoena, unless you have consented for this use). Information or documents protected by this Certificate cannot be disclosed to anyone else who is not connected with the research except, if there is a federal, state, or local law that requires disclosure (such as to report child abuse or communicable diseases but not for federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings, see below); if you have consented to the disclosure, including for your medical treatment; or if it is used for other scientific research, as allowed by federal regulations protecting research subjects. The Certificate cannot be used to refuse a request for information form personnel of the United States federal or state government agency sponsoring the project that is needed for auditing or program evaluation by the NIH, which is funding this project or for information that must be disclosed in order to meet the requirements of the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you from voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your involvement in this research. To secure your confidentiality, study records associated with your participation will correspond to a participant number and no personal identifiers will be associated with any of your responses. The only link between your identity and the participant number will be kept in a password-protected excel file on a server protected by a separate password. This consent form will be stored separately from the research data.  Study data corresponding to participant number will be maintained indefinitely as paper and electronic copies. Results of this study may be used in publications and presentations, as well as shared on databases such as the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive (NDA) or Open Science Framework (OSF).  Any personal information that could identify you will be removed before the data we collect are shared in any way, including with other researchers, in databases, or in publications and presentations.</p>
            <p>Your Worker ID will be used to distribute payment to you but will not be stored with your data. Please be aware that your Worker ID can potentially be linked to information about you on your public profile page, depending on the settings you have for your profile.  We will not be accessing any personally identifying information about you that you may have put on your public profile page.</p>
            <p>Any reports and presentations about the findings from this study will not include your name or any other information that could identify you. We may share the data we collect in this study with other researchers doing future studies – if we share your data, we will not include any information that could identify you.</p>
            <h2>Subject's Rights</h2>
            <p>Your participation is voluntary. You may stop participating at any time by closing the browser window or the program to withdraw from the study. Partial data will not be analyzed. If you want your research information released to an insurer, medical care provider, or any other person not connected with the research, you must provide consent to allow the researchers to release it. Lastly, the Certificate of Confidentiality will not be used to prevent disclosure for any purpose you have consented to in this informed consent document (ie release to the agency funding the study, NDA, OSF, etc).</p>
